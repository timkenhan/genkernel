*--*[*no-*]*ssh*::
    Includes or excludes SSH (dropbear) support for remote LUKS keys.
    When enabled, this will compile dropbear for you.

*--ssh-authorized-keys-file*=<file>::
    Specifies a user created authorized_keys file. By default genkernel
    will use '/etc/dropbear/authorized_keys'.

*--ssh-host-keys*=<create|create-from-host|runtime>::
    When set to *create*, which is the default value, genkernel will embed
    SSH host keys from '/etc/dropbear' and will create those keys when missing.
    When set to *create-from-host*, genkernel will embed SSH host keys from
    '/etc/dropbear' but will create those keys from '/etc/ssh' when missing
    (not recommended for security reasons).
    When set to *runtime*, genkernel will not embed any SSH host key in
    initramfs and dropbear will generate needed host key at runtime (`dropbear -R`).
