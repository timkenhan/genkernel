*--*[*no-*]*luks*::
    Includes or excludes LUKS support.
    When enabled, this will compile cryptsetup for you.

*--*[*no-*]*gpg*::
    Includes or excludes support for GnuPG 1.x, the portable standalone branch
    of GnuPG. A key can be made from
    `gpg --symmetric -o /path/to/LUKS-key.gpg /path/to/LUKS-key` .
    After that, re-point the *root_key* argument to the new .gpg file.

*--*[*no-*]*keyctl*::
    Includes or excludes support for keyutils keyctl.
    This way a LUKS passphrase can be loaded into a keyring at boot time
    to unlock multiple devices (root, swap, etc.) without retyping it for each
    one.
